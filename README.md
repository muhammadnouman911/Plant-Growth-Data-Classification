# 🌱 Plant Growth Data Classification

This project focuses on classifying plant growth patterns using different machine learning algorithms.  
Using features like soil quality, water levels, temperature, and more — we predict the growth category of plants.

The project includes implementations of:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 🧠 Models Used

Each model is implemented in a separate folder with:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model training and testing
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)
